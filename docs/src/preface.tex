In this project I will study a Multi-agent pickup \& delivery (MAPD) problem 
where multiple moving agents are placed into a known environment where they are
given potentially infinite stream
of tasks -- deliveries. In order for an agent to execute a task, it first has to
reach a pick-up location and then carry a package to a delivery location in a
collision-free manner. The
MAPD problem is to assign tasks to agents so that the average time of all 
deliveries is minimal.  The MAPD is a well studied problem which is known to be
NP-hard, so approximations and heuristics are developed to address variants of
the pick-up \& delivery problems. We can distinguish MAPD solutions into two
categories. One is centralized where one ``entity'' is assigning packages to
all agents. The other one is decentralized, where every agent decides for himself what
he's going to do. We will study MAPD solutions on grids that will be
similiar to real world environments, for example grids with tight corridors just
like in warehouses with many shelves next to each other. Agents are able to move
in four directions -- up, down, left or right. Big part of these environments
are obstacles which have to be avoided by agents. Every task is characterized by
its pickup location, delivery location and a realease time. I will study an
online version of the MAPD problem, where package pick-up and delivery locations
are known once they are released and not before. This leads to a possibility for
agents to change their scheduled tasks but only when they are not already carrying
a package. We forbid dropping packages anywhere other than at the delivery location
since it is more applicable in real world scenarios. 
We can see direct analogies of these scenarios to real 
world problems. Examples include robots in automated warehouses, 
aircraft-towing vehicles, video-game characters or even taxis who pick up and
drop off passengers.\cite{PDP}\cite{Liu}

In software project I will focus on creating a simulation tool for this problem
using Python programming language, more specifically \textit{PyEasyGraphics}
library.
The simulation tool will contain a graphical interface which will be rendering 
agents as they perform their tasks. Goal will be to create a robust tool, making
it easily adjustable for similiar multi-agent pathfinding problems. User will be
able to either create environment by drawing it using mouse or load existing
environment from a file. Environments will be created on grids and agents will
be able to move in four directions. I will try to implement features that will
make analysis ``by eye'' easier. For example, user will be able to track an
agent, which will display currently planned path for selected agent. Agents will
be respresented as circles 
distinguished by colors, making agents with assigned tasks have different
color than unemployed agents. Also agents carrying a package will be
distinguished by black shape in the middle.
In the second part of this project I will implement some existing solutions to 
this problem and compare them against each other and against my own solution as well.
I will compare these models on grids representing various real life instances. 


\vspace{5mm}\noindent In a potential following bachelor's thesis I would review
existing MAPD solutions and compare them to my own solution through experimental
evaluation in a greater detail.
